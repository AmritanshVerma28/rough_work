Hi Di,

Agenda: Agent Demo

Meeting Summary :

We showcased an agentic framework. These agents can be any LLM. The agentic framework can be semi-automated or fully automated. We can expand agents to various use cases to increase the accuracy of output.We can design several agents which can work together to solve a complex problem.

The key highlights of this framework are :  
1) RL feedback loop
2) Automatic error debugging
3) Integration with Jupyter Notebook sandbox environment
4) Human instruction can be added during the workflow
5) Dynamic decision-making based on the output
